# 大一上程序设计基础  大作业

同学群佬实在是tql！ From the A star algorithm at the beginning, to the Enxian Chou Algorithm, I name it, the solutions themselves had experience a tremendous upheaval. 

You can achieve the requirements via the A star Algorithm, under the belief of elegance and effectiveness. However, the game is originally intended for the players and there must be a elaborate approach of fulfilling it. Enxian Chou Algorithm undoubtedly summitted this aim.

My thought is far from intelligent, but rather dull and delightening. Due to the time limitness, when randomly swapping the pics, I made a record of them and utilized it when automatically reorganization.

做了一些微不足道的贡献！
